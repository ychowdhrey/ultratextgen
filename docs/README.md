# UltraTextGen — Docs & Infrastructure Map

> **This is a living document.** UltraTextGen's structure is developed
> *emergently* — lanes are added as the need becomes clear, not designed all at
> once. This map is the single place that says, for any piece of work, *which
> lane it belongs to and which doc governs it.* It is kept current by the
> [Weekly infrastructure review](#weekly-infrastructure-review) at the bottom.

Start here. If you're about to build or change something, find its **page
type** or **operational track** below and follow the linked governing doc.

---

## Shared principles (apply everywhere)

| Doc | What it governs |
|---|---|
| [`jtbd-principles.md`](./jtbd-principles.md) | The *why* + global rules: one primary intent per page, namespace = page type, title-matches-the-verb, declared canonical ownership, demand over combinatorics. |
| [`page-vs-section-decisions.md`](./page-vs-section-decisions.md) | The page-vs-section gate (supply × demand) for any companion/subdivision content. |

These are page-type-agnostic. Everything below is an *application* of them.

---

## Page types (content lanes)

Each content page lives in a namespace that encodes its type, schema, and the
workflow that produces it.

| Type | Namespace | Schema | Governing workflow | Source of record | Generator + validator | Maturity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Library** (symbol/emoji reference) | `/library/` | `Article` + `BreadcrumbList` | [`unicode-library-workflow.md`](./unicode-library-workflow.md) (+ [`unicode-forum-research-skill.md`](./unicode-forum-research-skill.md)) | `data/library_opportunities.csv` | `generate_library_page_from_spec.py` + `validate_library_pages.py` | ✅ fully systematized |
| **Category** (style generators) | `/category/` | `WebApplication` | [`jtbd-build-spec.md`](./jtbd-build-spec.md) (strategy) | `library_opportunities.csv` (`page_type=category`) | ❌ none | ⚠️ backlog + strategy, no generator |
| **Answers** (Q&A) | `/answers/` | `QAPage` / `FAQPage` | [`jtbd-build-spec.md`](./jtbd-build-spec.md) (strategy) | `library_opportunities.csv` (`page_type=answers`) | ❌ none | ⚠️ backlog + strategy, no generator |
| **Usecase** | `/usecase/` | `WebApplication` | ❌ undocumented | ❌ none | ❌ none | ❌ undocumented |
| **Guide** (articles) | `/guide/` | `Article` | ❌ undocumented | ❌ none | ❌ none | ❌ undocumented |
| **Platform** (social-network generators) | `/discord/`, `/instagram/`, `/x/`, … | `WebApplication` | ❌ undocumented | ❌ none | ❌ none | ❌ undocumented |

**Only the Library lane is structurally complete** (discovery → scouting →
research → volume → score → dedupe → spec → generate → validate → PR). The
other lanes have principles and, for category/answers, a strategy spec — but no
demand backlog or generator. See [Known gaps](#known-gaps).

## Operational tracks (cross-cutting)

These run across page types rather than producing a type.

| Track | Scripts | Doc | Cadence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Image SEO (hero art, OG cards) | `make-hero-decorative.py`, `add-og-dimensions.py`, `build-image-seo-status.py` | [`image-seo-fixes.md`](./image-seo-fixes.md) | per batch |
| Pinterest pins (+ new boards) | `generate-pinterest.py`, `generate-id-pins.py`, `generate-vertical-text-pins.py` (skin: `generate-site-art.py`); CSV: `pinterest_csv.py` + `build_pinterest_upload.py` | [`pinterest-pin-generation.md`](./pinterest-pin-generation.md) (board conventions) + [`pinterest-csv-format.md`](./pinterest-csv-format.md) | per batch |
| Schema / alternateName SEO | `validate-alternatenames.py`, `inject-faq-jsonld.js`, `alternatename-seo-report.md` | ⚠️ none | per batch |
| Collection-copy audit | `audit_library_opportunities.py` (+ explorer, see workflow §5) | ⚠️ workflow §5; [`emoji-combination-taxonomy.md`](./emoji-combination-taxonomy.md) for combo taxonomy | per batch |
| i18n / localization | `prerender-i18n.js` (+ `es/`, `locales/`, `README.*.md`) | ❌ none | as needed |
| CSS audit | `audit-css.js` | ❌ none (CI-only) | CI (`css-audit.yml`) |
| GTM check | `check-gtm.js` | ❌ none (CI-only) | CI (`gtm-check.yml`) |

---

## Automated workflows (`.github/workflows/`)

| Workflow | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `update-sitemap.yml` | daily 00:00 UTC | regenerate `sitemap.xml` (`[skip ci]`) |
| `update_readme.yml` | weekly (Mon 03:00 UTC) | sync README from sitemap (`sync-readme.js`) |
| `weekly-pr-digest.yml` | weekly (Mon 06:00 UTC) | classify merged PRs by lane → `docs/infra-review/<date>.md` + `latest.md` |
| `tweet-queue.yml` | daily 09:00 UTC (+ manual) | post qualifying commits (`tweet_queue.py`) |
| `css-audit.yml` | on `pull_request` | `audit-css.js` |
| `gtm-check.yml` | on `pull_request` | `check-gtm.js` (GTM snippet present) |
| `schedule-cache-removal.yml` | annual (Apr 10) + manual | cache maintenance |

### Scheduled routines (Claude Code on the web)

Not GitHub Actions — these are [routines](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/routines)
configured in the web UI ([claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines)),
not files in this repo. They run as full Claude sessions and open PRs for review.

| Routine | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Weekly infrastructure review | weekly schedule | run the [Weekly infrastructure review](#weekly-infrastructure-review); open a PR updating this map (no auto-merge) |

---

## Known gaps

The structure is emergent; these are the open infrastructure debts, tracked
here so they aren't lost. Update as they're closed or new ones appear.

1. ~~**Demand backlog is library-only.**~~ **Closed** — the opportunity CSV now
   carries a `page_type` column (default `library`) and the auditor dedupes
   per-lane, so scouting, the `stage` lifecycle, and the demand gate reach
   `/category/` and `/answers/`. (Still no generator for those lanes — see #2.)
2. **No production pipeline for category/answers.** Strategy exists
   (`jtbd-build-spec.md`); there is no generator/validator equivalent of the
   library lane. These pages are hand-built.
3. **Usecase and guide lanes are undocumented** — no workflow, no backlog.
4. **Operational tracks without docs:** schema/alternateName SEO, i18n, CSS/GTM
   CI checks. Scripts exist; the process is tribal knowledge.
5. **Platform pages lane is undocumented** — the eleven social-network generator
   pages (`/discord/`, `/instagram/`, `/x/`, …) receive SEO and FAQ updates but
   have no governing workflow, backlog, or generator. The classifier also has no
   rules for them, so PRs that touch those paths are flagged Unclassified.
6. **One Pinterest board is off-system.** The Spanish `/es/` board lives in an
   orphaned top-level `pinterest-kit/` (own generator, bundled fonts, hand-named
   CSV) instead of the `assets/pinterest/` + `data/*_upload.csv` pipeline every
   other board uses. Migrate it per `docs/pinterest-pin-generation.md`.

## Weekly infrastructure review

The routine that keeps this map honest and lets structure emerge from real work
instead of up-front design. It runs in **two parts** ("digest feeds AI"), wired
up under [`infra-review/`](./infra-review/):

- **Digest (automated).** The
  [`weekly-pr-digest.yml`](../.github/workflows/weekly-pr-digest.yml) Action
  runs every Monday, classifies the past 7 days of merged PRs by lane (via
  [`scripts/weekly_pr_digest.py`](../scripts/weekly_pr_digest.py)), and writes
  `infra-review/<date>.md` + `infra-review/latest.md`. PRs that don't match a
  known lane are flagged as a **signal**.
- **Review (judgment).** A scheduled Claude session consumes `latest.md` via
  [`infra-review/weekly-review-prompt.md`](./infra-review/weekly-review-prompt.md),
  updates this map, and opens a PR.

**Cadence:** weekly.

**Input:** `infra-review/latest.md` — all PRs merged to `main` in the last 7
days, pre-classified by lane.

**Steps (the review session):**

1. Read the digest's lane classification of the week's merged PRs.
2. For any PR flagged **Unclassified**, that's a **signal**: either a new lane is
   emerging (add a row to the tables above) or the classifier should learn the
   path (add a rule to `LANE_RULES` in `scripts/weekly_pr_digest.py`).
3. If a PR closed a gap, tick it off / update the maturity column.
4. Note recurring manual work — anything done by hand 3+ weeks running is a
   candidate to systematize (script, backlog column, or doc).
6. Open a PR with the updated map on a `claude/infra-review-<date>` branch — a
   small, additive diff. **Do not merge** (golden rule: a human reviews and
   merges). If the past 7 days produced no changes worth recording, say so and
   open nothing.

**Output:** a PR updating this map + a current [Known gaps](#known-gaps) list,
or an explicit "no changes" note. The goal is not to design the whole system
now — it's to make sure every new piece of work is *placed*, so the structure
reveals itself over time.

### Running it as a scheduled routine

This review runs as a **[routine](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/routines)**
(weekly schedule trigger), not a GitHub Action — creating/editing it lives in
the Claude Code web UI at [claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines),
not in this repo. The routine's prompt is intentionally thin and points back
here so the *process* stays version-controlled in this file. Paste this as the
routine prompt:

> Run the UltraTextGen **Weekly infrastructure review** exactly as documented in
> `docs/README.md` (the "Weekly infrastructure review" section). Input: all PRs
> merged to `main` in the last 7 days. Follow steps 1–6 there. Open a PR on a
> `claude/infra-review-<date>` branch with a small, additive diff to
> `docs/README.md`; **do not merge** — a human reviews it. If nothing this week
> warrants a map change, open no PR and end with a one-line "no changes" summary.
